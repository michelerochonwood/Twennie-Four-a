    <h3>The Challenge of Staying Switched On</h3>
    <p>When a B2B client hires you to complete a project, you become an arm of that client’s organization for the time it takes to complete the work, which makes you different from virtually any other service provider. Your ability to craft a satisfactory daily experience for that client determines your future business with that client, and perhaps with many others in their close-knit business community. That means: more than any other professionals in the marketplace, you have to be switched on at all times.  More than any web site, sales strategy, or marketing approach, this is what separates you from your competition. Strategies for remaining “switched-on” are the main goal of Twennie’s approach to the topic of business development in technical services.</p>

    <h3>The Project Lifecycle - According to the Client</h3>
    <p>Part of remaining “switched on” is paying attention to a client even when you’re not working for them – especially when you’re not working for them! Even if a project isn’t breaking ground for another year, for the client, it is still in an important stage of its lifecycle. Good business development relies on daily “ear-to-the-ground” activities and being seen by that client regularly, maintaining your credibility in their eyes. Just because a competitive project hasn’t officially gone to the RFP stage, doesn’t mean you can’t be positioning your team to win it. In fact, waiting for RFPs is the surest way to lose to your competitors. Who knows? Your competitors might have had lots of face time with that client leading up to the RFP. Are you that confident in your proposal writing abilities that you think your document alone will turn their heads?

    <h3>Clearing the Underbrush of Distractions</h3>
    <p>Developing business in technical services can become a clouded and convoluted subject. That’s because developing business involves activities most technical professionals find uncomfortable, like talking, negotiating, and accepting criticism. Over the past half-century, all those technical professionals around the world trying to avoid these tasks developed an Everest of forms, procedures, models, flowcharts, software, and buzzwords. Every last one of these were, on some level, defense mechanisms, barriers between service provider and client meant to mitigate the unpleasant task of candor. The challenge for today’s technical professional is to hack away that half-century of underbrush and really talk to client about the work. Twennie’s library has a few forms, procedures, and even a few buzzwords, but our goal is to help our members do what really matters in developing new business: connect with clients.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Saying No</h3>
    <p>One of the ways to know you’ve grown as a business developing organization, is that you find yourself saying no to work. This is the stage at which you’ve developed a portfolio and have distinguished yourself in your business community. The biggest change you must make at this stage is not a procedural one, but a cultural one. You must graduate to a new brand identity, one that can afford to be more particular about opportunities. This requires a change in thinking down to the most junior people in your organization. Your go/no go process will spring from this cultural shift. Only then will you procedurize it with forms and spreadsheets.</p>

    <h3>Defining Value, Not for You, But for the Client</h3>
    <p>The first step in developing new business is to ask yourself, what do clients value? In other words, what happens in a project to make this client your biggest fan? How do you deliver this work so that this client walks around with a smile, unable to stop talking about the great project you just delivered? Easy - you do the minimum as scoped in the RFP to keep our price down. Really? Is that it? Doesn’t that amount to the “minimum” also becoming the “maximum?” When you look at it from the client’s perspective, you’ll realize that the minimum is only their first step. Once minimum criteria are confirmed present, the client’s decision really begins. That’s why it’s critical to demonstrate value beyond the minimum. All your competitors can deliver on the minimum. It’s those of us who make good on subjective value who stand out.</p>

    <h3>The Bespoke Solution</h3>
    <p>Developing sharper client focus and understanding the diverse interpretation of value that exists among any client base is an ongoing challenge and a tough concept for learners to fully grasp, then harder still to employ practically in their daily business development activities. One size does not fit all when it comes to proposals. If clients could buy what they want off a shelf, they wouldn’t post RFPs. They would go to a retail outlet where everything is on shelves and all products are the same. If they’ve spent months (and perhaps years) planning this project and writing the RFP, why would any service provider then give them a proposal taken off a shelf? Twennie aims to provide inspiration for differentiating your offer from the offers of your competitors. </p>
