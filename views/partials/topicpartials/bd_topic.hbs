    <h3>The Challenge of Staying Switched On</h3>
    <p>When a B2B client brings you on for a project, you don’t just deliver a service. You become a part of their team for the duration of the work. That close integration sets technical professionals apart from nearly every other provider. The day-to-day experience you create for your client shapes not just the outcome of the project, but your ongoing relationship and reputation within their network. More than any website or sales pitch, it’s this consistent professionalism and presence that sets you apart. Twennie’s approach to business development focuses on helping you stay engaged, responsive, and “switched on” in the moments that matter most.</p>

    <h3>The Project Lifecycle - According to the Client</h3>
    <p>Staying “switched on” means staying engaged with your clients—even when you’re not actively working on a project. In fact, that in-between time can be the most important. For clients, projects are always in motion, even months or years before they break ground. Strong business development isn’t about waiting for RFPs to land. It’s about keeping your ear to the ground, staying visible, and nurturing trust long before the formal competition begins. Showing up consistently and staying attuned (switched on) to your client’s world puts your team in the best position to win—not just through proposals, but through presence.

    <h3>Clearing the Underbrush of Distractions</h3>
    <p>Business development in technical services can feel complicated—and for good reason. It often involves activities that fall outside the comfort zone of many technical professionals: things like negotiation, candid conversations, and the occasional tough feedback. Over time, industries have responded by building layers of systems—forms, flowcharts, models, software, all meant to create structure, but sometimes they end up creating distance instead. The real challenge today isn’t adding more tools. It’s cutting through the noise and reconnecting with what matters: honest, human conversations about the work. Twennie offers a curated library of tools and strategies, but more than anything, we help members strengthen the connection between service provider and client. That’s where business really begins.</p>

    <h3>The Milestone of Saying No</h3>
    <p>A clear sign of growth in business development is the ability to say no to work. It means you've built a solid portfolio and earned recognition in your business community. At this stage, the biggest shift isn’t just about process—it’s about culture. Your organization is stepping into a new phase, one where selectivity becomes part of your brand. That mindset needs to reach every level of the team, from senior leaders to junior staff. A thoughtful go/no-go process emerges naturally from this cultural evolution. Only then do the forms and spreadsheets come into play, supporting a philosophy that’s already in motion.</p>

    <h3>Defining Value, Not for You, But for the Client</h3>
    <p>The first step in developing new business is asking a simple but powerful question: What do clients truly value? What makes a client not just satisfied, but genuinely enthusiastic about working with you? What earns their trust and their future business? It’s tempting to think that delivering exactly what’s scoped in the RFP is enough. But from the client’s perspective, that’s just the starting line. Meeting the minimum requirements earns you a place at the table. Standing out requires something more: proactive thinking, thoughtful service, and the ability to create value beyond the checklist. That’s where real differentiation happens—and where lasting client relationships are built.</p>

    <h3>The Bespoke Solution</h3>
    <p>Sharpening client focus and understanding how different clients define value is a skill that takes time to develop and even more time to apply consistently in practice. It’s one of the most challenging aspects of business development, but also one of the most rewarding. No two clients are exactly alike, and no two proposals should be either. If clients could get what they needed off the shelf, they wouldn’t issue RFPs—they’d just go shopping. The fact that they’ve invested months, sometimes years, planning a project means they’re looking for insight, relevance, and a tailored response. Twennie helps teams move beyond generic proposals by offering strategies and inspiration to craft offers that stand out for all the right reasons.</p>
