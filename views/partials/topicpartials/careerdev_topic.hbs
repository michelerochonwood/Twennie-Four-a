    <h3>Pressure to Earn</h3>
    <p>As a technical professional in consulting, you are a source of revenue to your employer. Pressure to perform and earn can weigh on you. Consulting can be a tough business with demanding clients just waiting to rip you to shreds over a miniscule problem, and your manager is right around the corner waiting to ask you to stay ‘til 1am to finish six different projects.</p>

    <h3>Competition</h3>
    <p>You probably work in a highly competitive environment. Your job is not guaranteed and that can be stressful. Meanwhile, your coworkers are being awesome every day and never seem to run out of energy. They remember everything they read, and the boss loves them. You’re drowning in parent-teacher nights, chicken pox, and karate lessons, and they never seem to have family problems or obligations.</p>

    <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
    <p>You went into a technical field because it was comfortable and familiar to you. Then you found out that you had to talk to people, be a leader and mentor, negotiate contracts with difficult clients, write compelling articles and proposals, do presentations, and be generally charming at business cocktail parties. Where and when are you supposed to learn all that when you are under constant pressure to earn the company money and never needed these skills before?</p>

    <h3>Fewer Professional Development Options</h3>
    <p>Your industry is constantly changing, which means you have to adapt with less time than you need to do so. Every day your manager walks in with an announcement about something new, and it is sucking the life out of you. Plenty of technical training is available, but the soft skills? You’ve got to learn those on your own. But where and how? Can you learn to be charming from a book?</p>

    <h3>Directions and Decisions</h3>
    <p>Your career can go in a variety of directions. You can become a business developer, a manager, or a technical guru, but you have no idea which one is right for you. You might want to do only one, or two, but which ones? What if you want to do all three? What if your manager wants you to enter something you hate like poison?</p>

    <h3>Workplace Loneliness</h3>
    <p>The modern workplace tends to isolate people from each other, especially if those people are charged out by the hour. Your culture might emphasize individual achievement over teamwork. Maybe they discourage socializing. The goal with these strategies is to reduce distraction during work hours, but we forget how much working people need a connection with coworkers to be at their best.</p>
