    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 Rule, was first observed by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in 1896 when he noticed that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. He later found that this distribution appeared in many other areas of life and business, establishing a principle that suggests roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. This observation has since become a fundamental concept in business management, economics, and personal productivity.</p>

    <h3>The Power to Prioritize and Focus</h3>
    <p>In business applications, the Pareto Principle manifests in numerous ways. For instance, companies often find that 80% of their profits come from 20% of their customers, or that 80% of their sales are generated by 20% of their products. This insight helps organizations prioritize their resources and efforts, focusing on the vital few factors that produce the majority of results rather than the trivial many that contribute relatively little to the bottom line.

    <h3>80/20 and the Individual</h3>
    <p>The principle's relevance extends beyond business into personal life and time management. Working people often discover that 20% of their activities produce 80% of their satisfaction or success, while 80% of their stress might come from 20% of their problems. This understanding can help individuals make better decisions about how to allocate their time and energy, focusing on high-impact activities and relationships while minimizing involvement in less productive areas. However, it's important to note that these percentages are approximate and illustrative rather than exact mathematical relationships.</p>
