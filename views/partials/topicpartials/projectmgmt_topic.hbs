    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>The project management plan is the most frequently ignored or overlooked step in project management. People may have managed many projects and think they don’t need a plan because it’s all in their heads. So, they charge on and start the work, which is what really matters anyway. A project management plan is like a flight-plan. It can change mid-air, but it shouldn’t change without a good reason. The plan sets the course and reminds the team of the destination at moments when it really counts, during potential scope creep, delays, and misunderstandings. It feels like a chore when you create it, but its value proves itself again and again throughout the project.</p>

    <h3>People</h3>
    <p>“Project management” is a bit of a misnomer. You’re not actually managing a project, but rather the people completing it. This might be why project management is such a challenging discipline to learn. People are not technology. People have habits that need breaking and attitudes that need adjusting, but if you look at it that way, you will surely make them less inclined to engage with the work in a constructive way. Managing people is always best done as a pull rather than push strategy, because people don’t like being pushed. Pushing just makes them slam on the mental brakes. They want to think that everything they do is in some way their idea, which is when they do their best work. That is the biggest challenge for the project manager – to engage people in ways that help them experience satisfaction and inspiration in their work. The work they produce under these conditions will speak for itself.

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>Project objectives advance only because of effective communication. Think of project management communication as a cellular network. People are the stationary objects like towers and servers. Messages are the signals, the dynamic elements that connect those stationary objects so the network can do its job. Like with a cellular network, messages must be continuously flowing. Some will happen every hour, some every day. Some are only needed at weekly and monthly intervals. Either way, if communication breaks down, everything grinds to a halt. </p>

    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>Don’t let the word “analytics” scare you. It is not the high-tech term you might think it is. “Analytics” refers simply to knowledge gathered while managing projects, such as lessons learned, and meaning derived from that knowledge. A lesson learned means that a method or habit has been proven either successful or unsuccessful, and analytics means that we have a process for remembering that lesson, and a system for revisiting it on future projects. No matter how high-tech analytics get with data management software, statisticians, or AI, at its core, this is what analytics means. That’s why every operation can use analytics, no matter how small and low-tech.</p>

    <h3>Lean</h3>
    <p>Lean project management focuses on maximizing value while minimizing waste through continuous improvement and efficiency. Originally developed in manufacturing, “lean” emphasizes delivering only what customers truly value by eliminating non-essential activities, reducing work in progress, and streamlining workflows. Lean includes identifying value from the customer's perspective, mapping value streams, creating flow, establishing pull-based systems, and pursuing excellence through iteration. By implementing lean practices, organizations can reduce costs, improve quality, shorten delivery times, and enhance customer satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Portfolio Management</h3>
    <p>When organizations oversee multiple interconnected projects simultaneously, “project management” naturally evolves into “portfolio management.” While project managers focus on individual project success, portfolio management takes a higher-level view by selecting, prioritizing, and balancing projects based on organizational goals, resource constraints, and risk tolerance. This evolution requires developing systems to evaluate project alignment with strategy, optimize resource allocation across projects, and ensure the overall portfolio delivers maximum business value while maintaining acceptable risk levels.</p>
