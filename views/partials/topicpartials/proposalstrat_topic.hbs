    <h3>Win Themes</h3>
    <p>At the heart of every strong proposal is a compelling win theme—an idea that weaves through the document, reinforcing why your firm is the right choice. A win theme isn’t just a catchy message; it’s your value proposition clearly expressed and consistently supported, both in writing and visually. It reflects your deep understanding of the client, the project, and the outcomes they care about most. When done well, it helps your proposal stand apart—not through repetition, but through resonance.</p>

    <h3>Show That You're Paying Attention</h3>
    <p>Clients want to know you’ve truly listened, that you understand their project, their priorities, and what success means to them. That means going beyond general qualifications. It means tailoring your message, aligning it with their goals, and responding with specifics that demonstrate thoughtful attention. Twennie supports proposal writers in creating documents that feel personal, relevant, and clearly focused on the client’s needs.</p>

    <h3>Define Success on Their Terms</h3>
    <p>Before showcasing your strengths, take the time to define success through the client’s eyes. When your proposal reflects their language, goals, and vision, your firm becomes easier to imagine as a partner. The more closely your understanding aligns with theirs, the stronger your case. And if the fit doesn’t feel right, stepping back can be a strategic decision too. Twennie helps teams build this judgment into their proposal approach.</p>

    <h3>The RFP Is Not the Whole Story</h3>
    <p>The RFP gives you a roadmap, but not the full picture. While it lists formal evaluation criteria, many of the factors that influence a decision are never written down. Evaluators bring personal perspectives and preferences to the table, which means the strongest proposals go beyond compliance. They build trust, speak to both logic and emotion, and show a clear understanding of what really matters. Twennie helps proposal teams read between the lines and respond with insight.</p>

    <h3>Evidence of Experience, Interest, and Care</h3>
    <p>Clients are looking for more than promises. They’re looking for proof. That’s why relevant experience, clearly presented, matters so much. It shows you’ve done this kind of work before and can do it again. The more specific your examples, the better. Use data to quantify the effort, challenges, and results. When you present facts with clarity, you help the client make their case internally and show them that your team is prepared, capable, and engaged.</p>

    <h3>Understand the Competition</h3>
    <p>Smart proposals don’t just showcase your strengths. They anticipate what others might offer and respond with distinction. That starts with knowing your competitors. What do they do well? Where might they fall short? Listening to client feedback, tracking debriefs, and studying past pursuits helps you position your team with purpose. Twennie encourages a reflective, research-based approach to competitor analysis that informs stronger, more focused proposals.</p>
