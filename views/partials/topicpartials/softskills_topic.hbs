    <h3>The Rude Awakening</h3>
    <p>You went into a technical field because it was comfortable and familiar to you. Then you found out that you had to talk to people, be a leader and mentor, negotiate contracts with difficult clients, write compelling articles and proposals, do presentations, and be generally charming at business cocktail parties. Where and when are you supposed to learn all that when you are under constant pressure to earn the company money and never needed these skills before?</p>

    <h3>Soft Skills are Learned Differently</h3>
    <p>Can you learn to play the piano by reading a book about playing piano? We all know the answer to that. Some skills require you to build muscle memory over time by doing. Anything that involves managing working relationships, negotiation, or communication fall under this definition. These are considered “soft” skills and aren’t learned in a traditional classroom. Colleges and universities are aware of this challenge. They incorporate soft skills material into instruction and exercises, but formal learning institutions are also under pressure to deliver as much technical learning as possible within a short window, so soft skills inevitably play second fiddle.

    <h3>We're a Team</h3>
    <p>Ask most managers and they’ll agree—teamwork is essential to success. Yet many workplace systems unintentionally send the opposite message. Cubicles, individual KPIs, and recognition programs often reward solo achievements rather than collaboration. The good news is that teamwork is a skill like any other: it can be developed through practice. Even small, focused exercises can make a meaningful difference. Twennie helps technical teams build stronger habits of working together—without taking too much time away from the work itself.</p>

    <h3>Introverts Can Learn to Schmooze</h3>
    <p>Introverts can absolutely succeed in business development and leadership, but traditional advice often misses the mark. For many introverted professionals, interacting with others can be mentally and emotionally draining. Client calls feel like a task to power through, and networking events can leave them exhausted. But thriving in these roles doesn’t require turning into a charismatic extrovert. It’s about learning how to manage energy, set boundaries, and recover well. Twennie is committed to exploring strategies that support introverted professionals so they can lead, connect, and contribute without burning out. </p>

    <h3>Have you Misinterpreted "Soft Skills"?</h3>
    <p>When people hear “soft skills,” they sometimes picture a smooth-talking performer, a motivational speaker with a polished voice and a knack for commanding a room. But real influence doesn’t come from sounding like a celebrity. In business development and leadership, success depends less on how well you deliver a speech and more on how well you listen, adapt, and respond in the moment. Twennie focuses on these essential, everyday skills—the kind that strengthen relationships and help you lead with impact.</p>

    <h3>Failure Isn't What you Think</h3>
    <p>When it comes to technical work, failure isn’t taken lightly, and for good reason. Standards, peer reviews, and testing protocols all exist to prevent costly mistakes. But relationships don’t follow the same blueprint. There are no rehearsals, no simulations, just real conversations with real consequences. For many technical professionals, that unpredictability can be uncomfortable. It’s easy to overanalyze missteps or assume they reflect deeper flaws. Twennie helps reframe that thinking by offering tools and exercises that bring clarity, build confidence, and make navigating relationships feel less risky and more rewarding.</p>
