      <div class="teach-me-section" id="member-membership-types">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">membership types</h3>
        <p>Twennie members include individuals, group members, and group leaders. Dashboard features vary slightly by type. Individuals can access the same library as other members, but groups and their leaders have added functionality for collaborative learning. Separate videos for members and leaders provide further instruction, so be sure to view the one that’s specific to your membership type. To make it easier, we've included them all on this page.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="member-topics">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">topics</h3>
        <p>In the topics tab, you’ll see your three core topics. You can select these in your profile view. You can access the library's resources on these topics by clicking here, which takes you to the topic page. These topics also determine the emails you receive notifying you of added library units, so it’s important to keep these up to date. You don’t want to miss any new developments in your topics of interest. You can change your topics any time in your profile edit form.</p>

        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">prompt sets</h3>
        <p>When you register for prompt sets, they show up here in your registered prompt set tab. A prompt set is a set of activities you can complete daily, weekly or monthly. They help you develop new knowledge or habits over time without taking up billable hours. You can register for up to three prompt sets at a time. Submit notes for each prompt and earn completion badges.</p>

        <p>In the contribute to the library tab, you can add your own learning units to the library. The sky’s the limit here. You can add units to any topic, any time. Units are subject to approval by the Twennie team, and we are open to a wide variety of content. If you don’t find the topic you’re looking for, you can suggest a new one. Just go to the topics page and find the end tab which reads, new topic. Here you can suggest a new topic for the library. When you want to create a unit for the library, access the upload form through this tab. An instructional video is there to walk you through all the steps.</p>

        <p>In the "my library units" tab, you will find the list of all units you’ve added to the library. If they need edits, this is where you access them. In the coming year, this tab will be able to tell you who on Twennie has accessed your units. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="member-tags">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">tagged units</h3>
        <p>If you’ve tagged any library units for future use, you'll find them in the tagged units tab. This makes it easy to find something, and just in case you don’t have the time when you find it in the library and want to save it for later, tag it so you can find it in your dashboard. </p>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-membership-types">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">membership overview</h3>
        <p>Leaders manage their membership in the membership overview tab. This section tells you the status of your membership. As a leader, you’ll see the names of your members and organization, and a summary of what you can access at your subscription level. Any time you want to change your membership, this is where you’ll do it, under change my membership. If you want to change the people on your team, you do that in group overview. </p>
      </div>
<div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-membership-types">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">group overview</h3>
        <p>Under the group overview tab, you will see all members of your group. If they’ve registered, their profile card will show as registered. Here you can view their profiles. You can also check up on them and see the learning they’ve been doing. As you can see, your available slots show, reminding you that you can add more people. Down here you can add and delete members.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-profiles">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">profiles</h3>
        <p>Your profile is visible to all Twennie members. If you want to use your profile to showcase your contributions to the library, you can share the link with anyone you wish, and maybe even invite them to become members. As the Twennie community grows, your learning and development network will benefit. Leaders have two profiles – one for themselves and one for their group. The group profile is an excellent place to brag on your group’s learning achievements. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-topics">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">team topics</h3>

      </div>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-prompt-sets">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">prompt sets</h3>
        <p>In prompt set progress, you’ll see your progress on your prompt sets and any prompt sets you’ve completed. (Your team’s progress is not tracked here. That’s shown in your report center.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-contribute">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">contributing to the library</h3>
        <p>In the "contribute to the library" tab, you can add your own learning units to the library. If you’re using Twennie to manage all your internal learning and development, this tab will be really important.  The sky’s the limit here. You can add units to any topic, any time. Your group can also add units. Units are subject to approval by the Twennie administrators - we are open to a wide variety of content. You can use our unit forms to create learning experiences for your team, coworkers, or for multiple teams across your organization. Each upload form contains a video with instructions taht walk you through the process of creating a library unit.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-contribute">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">contributing to the library</h3>
        <p>In the "my library units" tab you will find the list of all units you’ve added to the library and the units submitted by your team. If these units need edits, this is where you access them. Only the author can make edits to their units, so if you see a unit posted by a teammember and it requires edits, collaborate internally with your team to get those edits done.</p>
      </div>

<div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-assign">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">tagged units</h3>

        <p>Use tags or assignment tools to prompt members to review specific units. Assigned content appears in their dashboards.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="teach-me-section" id="leader-reporting">
        <h3 style="teach-me-heading">report center</h3>
        <p>When you’re going through the library, you’ll find units you’d like to share with your team. There are two ways for leaders to draw their team members’ attention to a unit in the library. First, you can assign that unit to that member using tags. Every unit contains a link called “tag this unit.” A window will open asking you to name the tag. Then you will see a list of the members of your team. You can choose team members you’d like to ask to review the unit.</p>
<p>You can also assign prompt sets. This is done in the view showing the individual prompt set. Only leaders can see the “assign this prompt set” button. When you click this button, you’ll be able to choose a frequency for prompt set completion. We recommend that you assign daily or weekly prompt completion, because monthly requires 20 months, almost two years. By the time this team member completes the set, it might be outdated. You also want your learning and development to have sufficient momentum and continuity. The prompt set will show up in that team member's dashboard and you can track their progress in the report center.
