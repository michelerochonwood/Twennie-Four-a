        <h3>Membership Types</h3>
        <p>Twennie members include individuals, group members, and group leaders. Dashboard features vary slightly by type. Individuals can access the same library as other members, but groups and their leaders have added functionality for collaborative learning. Separate videos for members and leaders provide further instruction, so be sure to view the one that’s specific to your membership type.</p>

These topics also determine the emails you receive notifying you of added library units, so it’s important to keep these up to date.
